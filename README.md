# 💻 Operating System (OS) Lab Programs

This repository contains standard **Operating System lab programs** implemented in C. These programs cover key OS concepts such as **CPU scheduling**, **memory management**, and **page replacement algorithms**, frequently used in university OS labs and placement preparation.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧵 CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**: Non-preemptive scheduling based on process arrival order.
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Non-preemptive scheduling prioritizing the shortest burst time.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Schedules processes based on assigned priority values.
- **Round Robin**: Preemptive scheduling using time quantum for fairness.

### 🔁 Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Replaces the oldest page in memory.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.
- **Optimal**: Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest future duration.
